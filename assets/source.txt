::Start
Of course everything is going wrong on your vacation. You get away from the base for a five day getaway in the historic foothills of Charon and you're one day behind, two suitcases short, and three hundred thousand miles from the bed and breakfast you booked. You're only just now passing [[Venus]].


::Venus
In the late 3080s, Venus was purchased by Cairo McVeigh, the late-in-life quintillionaire and founder of Excelsior Machines, the largest anti-gravity solutions company on Earth. McVeigh spent quadrillions to acquire the planet from its previous owner, [[Odious Sneed]], who spent her trillions on terraforming the planet to build a lavish summer home.


::Odious Sneed
Sneed's company, KROM, was a direct competitor of Excelsior. When a series of questionable emails from Sneed's private servers were leaked, KROM's stock prices plummeted. To pour salt in the wound, McVeigh acquired Venus and had Sneed's [[mansion and grounds]] destroyed.


::mansion and grounds
Since then, you've always been curious about the place. What beautiful vistas would a quintillionaire's private planet hold? What exquisite architectures? What [[grave secrets|this.setBg ('ship').then (this.goto.bind (this, 'grave secrets'))]]?


::grave secrets
The steering wheel jerks in your hands. You look down at your dashboard and see a series of flickering lights. You're not a ship expert, but [[something is wrong]].


::something is wrong
You feel the shudder of your engine turn into a sort of wheezing before it shuts off entirely. You try to engage the backup boosters but the display is frozen. You make your necessary preparations as your faithful old B-Line 500 plummets toward [[Venus|this.goto('The crash')]].


::The crash
Your ship crashes into the planet. Thanks to the forcefields -- and your airbags -- you and your ship survive. When you reboot the system, it appears that despite some scary-looking surface damage, you only need a few repairs before you can get this hunk of bolts back in the air.

Of course, you're not sure you can call a mechanic [[around these parts|this.setBg ('courtyard esque').then (this.goto.bind (this, 'around these parts'))]].


::around these parts
To the east, on top of an enormous mountain, you see a [[hideously large estate|this.setBg ('estate').then (this.goto.bind (this, 'hideously large estate'))]]. Your [[ship|this.setBg ('ship').then (this.goto.bind (this, 'ship'))]], looking a bit beat up, sits nearby.


::ship
Your ship has seen better days, but you're confident it'll pull through. Your B-Line 500 was top of the line back in 3085, and despite a few hiccups, it still runs like the day you bought it. You just about blew out your savings for it, so you're glad it hasn't let you down.

To repair your ship, you need to find a toolbox, an engine band, and a range emitter.

[[Go back|this.back()]]


::hideously large estate
The estate is unbelievable. It looks more like a small town. This must belong to Cairo McVeigh. Rumour has it that he never leaves his estate, so you're sure you can catch him. Whether he'll help a poor schmuck like you might be another issue.

[[Go to the estate|this.setBg ('gate').then (this.goto.bind (this, 'estate'))]]


::estate
You walk along a dirt pathway that leads to the foot of the mountain. A single staircase winds up to the front gates of the estate. It takes you a good hour to make it up.

Finally, you reach the front gate. Beyond the bars you can see a lush courtyard, filled with fountains, trees, and gravel pathways. Next to the gate is a video screen and what you assume is a doorbell. A gatebell. Whatever.

[[Ring the bell|this.goto('bell')]]


::bell
You ring the bell. A message pops up on a little screen above the button.

"No need to ring, friend! Please come in."

You think this is a bit weird, since you are not friends with Cairo McVeigh. But you need to fix your ship.

The gate opens.

[[Enter the gate|this.setBg ('grounds').then (this.goto.bind (this, 'grounds'))]]


::grounds
You enter the gate. You follow the gravel pathway, admiring the beauty of the grounds. You don't run into anyone, but you can still faintly hear the sound of conversation.

The path leads you to an enormous mansion. It's easily five, ten times as big as your house, and it's only one of the many estate buildings you could see from the base of the mountain.

The mansion doors are open.

[[Enter the mansion|this.setBg ('foyer1').then (this.goto.bind (this, 'foyer'))]]


::foyer
You enter the foyer of McVeigh's mansion. A questionably tasteful fountain stands in the middle of the room, at the foot of a gigantic, two-pronged staircase. A velvet carpet connects the front door to the stairs and to two doors on your left and right.

[[Go left|this.setBg ('dining room').then (this.goto.bind (this, 'dining room'))]]
[[Go right|this.setBg ('chairs2').then (this.goto.bind (this, 'sitting room'))]]
[[Go upstairs|this.setBg ('hallway').then (this.goto.bind (this, 'upstairs hallway'))]]
(this.ardanthium && this.band && this.toolbox){[[Go outside|this.goto('ending start')]]}
(!this.ardanthium || !this.band || !this.toolbox){[[Go outside|this.setBg ('grounds').then (this.goto.bind (this, 'grounds2'))]]}


::grounds2
You stand on the gravel pathway in front of the mansion. Arrangements of trees and flowers litter the grounds around you.

[[Go inside|this.setBg ('foyer1').then (this.goto.bind (this, 'foyer'))]]
[[Go back to your ship|this.setBg ('ship').then (this.goto.bind (this, 'ship'))]]


::dining room
You enter a lavish dining room. Fifteen chairs sit at an enormous table. Video screens hang like paintings around the room, each showing clips of Cairo McVeigh posing, interacting with the public, and performing outstanding feats.

[[Go to the kitchen|this.setBg ('kitchen').then (this.goto.bind (this, 'kitchen'))]]
[[Go to the foyer|this.setBg ('foyer1').then (this.goto.bind (this, 'foyer'))]]


::kitchen
The kitchen is big, but not as dramatic as the rest of the rooms. It's clearly sizeable enough to prepare a banquet, but nothing is ostentatious. It's a functional room.

(!this.chefdone){A [[chef|this.setVideo('chef').then(this.goto.bind(this,'chef'))]] is chopping vegetables nearby. }
(this.chefdone){A chef is chopping vegetables nearby. }
There are a large number of [[kitchen utensils]] on the countertops.

[[Go back to the dining room|this.setBg ('dining room').then (this.goto.bind (this, 'dining room'))]].


::chef
"Oh, uh, members aren't supposed to be in the kitchen. You'd better head back to the garden party."

[[I'm not a member|this.goto('chef oh')]]
[[What are you talking about?|this.goto('chef oh')]]


::chef oh
"Oh! Uh... what are you doing here? Am I in trouble?"

[[I crashed nearby and need repairs.|this.goto('chef stuff')]]
[[Why would you be in trouble?|this.goto('chef nervous')]]


::chef nervous
"Oh, uh, never mind. Nothing. Nothing! Uh... Why are you here, then?"

[[I need some materials to repair my ship.|this.goto('chef stuff')]]


::chef stuff
(this.chefdone=true){}"I don't know much about most of those things. If you need to make a new ardanthium conduit, though, all my utensils are made out of ardanthium. You could probably use a set of tongs or something!"

[[Thank you!|this.hideVideo().then(this.goto.bind(this,'kitchen'))]]


::kitchen utensils
You sift through the kitchen utensils. (!this.chefdone){You're no kitchen expert, but none of this looks useful to you.}
(this.chefdone && !this.ardanthium){(this.ardanthium=true){}You find a set of ardanthium tongs. You can use these to make a conduit.}


(this.jeans){(this.band=true){}You pull out the jeans and use a kitchen knife to cut a replacement engine band out of them.}

[[back|this.goto('kitchen')]]


::sitting room
The sitting room is very modern. It reminds you of a hotel lobby â€” impersonal and tasteful.

Save for a few plants and video screens, there's not much to see or do.

Through a set of glass doors there is a beautiful garden.

[[Go to the garden|this.setBg ('garden').then (this.goto.bind (this, 'garden'))]]
[[Go to the foyer|this.setBg ('foyer1').then (this.goto.bind (this, 'foyer'))]]


::garden
The garden is just as lush as the grounds in the front of the mansion, but contained by a fence. There is a large white tent with a podium and a few chairs inside.

(!this.toolbox){A [[person in a black robe|this.setVideo('cult').then(this.goto.bind(this,'person in a black robe'))]] mills about nearby.}
(this.toolbox){A person in a sky blue robe mills about nearby.}

[[Go to the sitting room|this.setBg ('chairs2').then (this.goto.bind (this, 'sitting room'))]]


::person in a black robe
"Good evening, friend. Where is your robe?"

[[I lost it.|this.goto('cult robe')]]
[[What robe?|this.goto('cult who')]]


::cult robe
"Oh dear. You should get a new one right away! He won't be happy about this."

[[I just need to repair my ship.|this.goto('cult parts')]]
[[Who are you talking about?|this.goto('cult who')]]


::cult who
"Ah, you must be new. Forgive me. Do you need any help?"

[[I need parts to repair my ship.|this.goto('cult parts')]]


::cult parts
(this.toolbox=true){}
"Ooh, er, there's a toolbox around here somewhere! We had a repairman and he... er... left it here... ah, here it is."

[[Thank you.|this.goto('cult goodbye')]]


::cult goodbye
"Good luck with your ship!"

[[Goodbye.|this.hideVideo().then(this.goto.bind(this,'garden'))]]


::upstairs hallway
The upstairs hallway is lightly decorated. There are a number of doors, most of which are locked. There's one unlocked door that seems to lead to a guest bedroom.

[[Go to guest bedroom|this.setBg ('bedroom').then (this.goto.bind (this, 'guest bedroom'))]]
[[Go back downstairs|this.setBg ('foyer').then (this.goto.bind (this, 'foyer')]]


::guest bedroom
The bedroom is simple. There is a [[twin bed]], a window, a [[closet]], and a [[chest of drawers|this.setBg ('drawer').then (this.goto.bind (this, 'chest of drawers'))]].

[[Go back into the hallway|this.setBg ('hallway').then (this.goto.bind (this, 'upstairs hallway'))]]


::twin bed
The bed is very nicely made. There's nothing underneath.

[[Go back|this.back()]]


::closet
The closet is immaculate. There is an ironing board and an iron.

[[Go back|this.back()]]


::chest of drawers
Most of the drawers are full of black robes. There are a few street clothes as well, including t-shirts, underwear, (this.jeans){and socks.}
(!this.jeans){socks, and [[jeans]].}


[[Go back|this.back()]]


::jeans
(this.jeans=true){}
The jeans, you notice, are stretchy. If you cut a loop out of them, you'd have an engine band. Not a great one, but one that could hold long enough to get to a planet with a mechanic shop. But you'll need something to cut the jeans.

[[Take the jeans|this.setBg ('bedroom').then (this.goto.bind (this, 'guest bedroom'))]]


::ending start
With all the pieces you need, you're ready to leave this bizarre paradise. You feel like there must be something more going on here, some mystery, but you're already late for your getaway and you want to make it before the salsa dancing class.

As you go to leave the mansion, though, you hear [[a sound behind you]].


::a sound behind you
You turn and see a strange man in a fashionable suit. He looks familiar to you, but you can't quite place him. [[He gestures toward you|this.setVideo('evil').then(this.goto.bind(this,'He gestures toward you'))]].


::He gestures toward you
"Stop right there, friend! I'm afraid I can't let you leave."

[[Why not?|this.goto('cairo why')]]
[[Who are you?|this.goto('cairo who')]]


::cairo who
"My name is Cairo McVeigh, founder and CEO of Excelsior, and the owner of this fine establishment!"

[[Why can't you let me leave?|this.goto('cairo why')]]


::cairo why
"Ah, yes! I was just about to get to that. Adrian, please collect our guest!"

Someone grabs you from behind and shoves [[a bag over your head|this.hideVideo().then(this.setBg.bind(this, 'dining room')).then(this.goto.bind(this,'a bag over your head'))]].


::a bag over your head
You wake up and find yourself tied to a chair in the dining room. Cairo McVeigh paces back and forth before you, muttering.

[[Hello?|this.setVideo('evil').then(this.goto.bind(this,'cairo hello'))]]
[[What's going on??|this.setVideo('evil').then(this.goto.bind(this,'cairo hello'))]]


::cairo hello
"Ah, you're awake! I'm sorry for the theatrics, but I couldn't let you leave before I gave you my pitch."

[[What pitch?|this.goto('cairo pitch')]]
[[Let me go!|this.goto('cairo go')]]


::cairo go
"Please, just listen to me. I don't want to hurt you. I just need you to help me."

[[With what?|this.goto('cairo pitch')]]
[[Let me go!!|this.goto('cairo pitch')]]


::cairo pitch
"In my mind, I saw it. It was beautiful... It was the finest scenic getaway and spa this side of the Milky Way! At least, that's what the ads were supposed to say."

[[Ads?|this.goto('cairo ad')]]
[[Let me go!!!|this.goto('cairo ad')]]


::cairo ad
"I blew my whole budget on this ad campaign, but those fiends just ran off with my money and never published a single ad. Now no one will come here! And Sneed is going around spreading rumours that I run some sort of cult... it's killing me!"

[[The black robes are very culty.|this.goto('cairo robes')]]
[[Who took your money?|this.goto('cairo money')]]


::cairo robes
"I wanted blue bathrobes. They gave me black cloaks instead. Horrid! They said was some sort of manufacturing mistake... Likely story. Animals! Charlatans!"

[[Who are you talking about?|this.goto('cairo money')]]


::cairo money
"Advantage Image Consulting. They're crooks! They swindled me out of my fortune. They said they would take care of everything. They said they would help me make this place the ultimate getaway! But now it's just me and my staff, living off the land, hoping for a customer. Any customer. Stupid. So, so stupid."

[[So why kidnap me?|this.goto('cairo kidnap')]]


::cairo kidnap
"Oh dear, right! Ugh... I'm sorry to have kidnapped you. That was unnecessary. I'm just... goodness. This whole thing is a mess. A horrible, horrible mess..."

[[Can I go now?|this.goto('cairo need')]]


::cairo need
"No... you can't leave. You need to help me! Just... stay for a few days. Leave a review. A bad review, even! I just need to prove that this resort exists. It won't cost you a thing."

[[Uh, okay.|this.goto('stay ending')]]
[[No!!!!|this.goto('go ending')]]


::stay ending
"Oh god, thank you. Thank you thank you thank you. You won't regret this. I'll have my staff repair your ship and fix you a room."

[[Okay.|this.hideVideo().then(this.setBg.bind(this, 'foyer1')).then(this.goto.bind(this,'stay2'))]]


::stay2
Cairo unties you and leads you into the foyer. Several robed figures usher you up the stairs to one of the guest rooms. After you settle in, another robed figure enters your room with a lavish spread of hors d'oeuvres and a massage table. Hey, now. This isn't so bad. Maybe after enough massages you'll leave the kidnapping out of your [[Yelp review|this.goto('stay3')]].


::stay3
As for your Charon package, well... it's probably too late for a refund, and if you're being completely honest, it was going to be too crowded and you were going to be miserable drinking your watery cocktails by the dirty poolside, and you'd try desperately to pretend that being on vacation was better than being at work just because you paid through the nose for it. And hey, a robed figure just came into your room with a pitcher of margaritas, so, to hell with it. A Venus vacation it is.

[[THE END|this.goto('START')]]


::go ending
"I... uh... well... I did kidnap you, I suppose. That's fair."

[[Yeah.|this.goto('go2')]]


::go2
"Er... okay. You can go. But please just... mention I have a spa here. To somebody. Anybody. I just want people to know it's here. It would mean the world to me."

[[Yes.|this.hideVideo().then(function {this.yesend=true}.bind(this)).then(this.goto.bind(this,'go3'))]]
[[No.|this.hideVideo().then(function {this.noend=true}.bind(this)).then(this.noend=true;this.goto.bind(this,'go3'))]]
[[Maybe.|this.hideVideo().then(function {this.maybeend=true}.bind(this)).then(this.maybeend=true;this.goto.bind(this,'go3'))]]

::go3
Cairo unties you. You rush out of the estate and get to your ship. As you repair your ship, you decide to extend your Charon getaway. A few days, maybe. A few weeks. Whatever it takes to forget that you ever had the [[misfortune|this.setBg('space').then(this.goto.bind(this, 'go4'))]] of crash-landing on Venus.

::go4
(this.yesend){After you reach cruising altitude, you leave a Yelp review for McVeigh's spa. It's heavy on the kidnapping aspect, but it does mention the gorgeous grounds and facilities. You give the experience two out of five stars.}
(this.noend){As you fly away, you look down at McVeigh's doomed resort. It's a tragic tale, and one you won't soon forget. Well, maybe after a couple margaritas.}
(this.maybeend){You consider leaving a Yelp review, but it just doesn't seem worth it. You probably weren't even going to leave one for the bed and breakfast on Charon. You take off in your ship and hope you never land on Venus again.}

[[THE END|this.goto('START')]]
